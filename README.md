# Projects in Java

So far I find this to be my favorite language due to its wide compatibility.
Partially, this view is supported by the enthusiasm and great direction my professor has for the subject. 

Currently it contains projects I have completed for school. 
These projects tested ideas of abstract data types such as linked lists, binary search trees as well as linked lists bounded by arrays. 
Furthermore, we tested our knowledge of recursion in a simple palindrome verification program. 

I hope to add more to this repository as I experiment with the possibilities of the capabilities of the Java language.
